Webgl Build Tips
- When you build a webgl project from unity you have to upload the build files includes(Build, TemplateData, index.html) to a server

- We use amazon aws

- Once uploaded in the server inside the Build folder we select the .data.br file and edit the metadata, System defined - Content-Encoding = br
System defined - Content-Type = binary/octet-stream

- Then select the .framework.js.br and edit the metadata,
System defined - Content-Encoding = br
System defined - Content-Type = application/javascript

- Then select the .wasm.br and edit the metadata,
System defined - Content-Encoding = br
System defined - Content-Type = application/wasm

- You then should be able to open the project by going to the index link
